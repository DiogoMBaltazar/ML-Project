Assigned Project: Bank Loans*

    --> formulate business model
    --> analyze data
    --> prepare for modelling (one hot encoding, normalization, feature selection, etc)
    --> apply an ML model
    --> Cross validation for model tuning
    --> Performance & evaluation metrics
    
    
    
    * Models for predicting whether or not an applicant should be accepted for a loan
      are widely used, and a very common implementation of machine learning
      practices. This dataset contains 1,000,000 rows of data and 21 features, and the
      goal is to predict which individuals will be accepted for a loan. Note that are
      important fairness considerations for this problem in making sure your model is
      not discriminatory.
